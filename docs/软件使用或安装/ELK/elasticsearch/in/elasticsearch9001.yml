# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster   集群 -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
cluster.name: clusterName
#
# ------------------------------------ Node   节点 ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
node.name: node9001
# node.roles: [master,data]
node.roles: [master]
#
# Add custom attributes to the node:
#
#node.attr.rack: r1
#
# ----------------------------------- Paths   路径   ------------------------------------
#
# Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):
#
path.data: ./data
#
# Path to log files:
#
path.logs: ./logs
#
# ----------------------------------- Memory   内存   -----------------------------------
#
# Lock the memory on startup:  内存交换对节点的性能和稳定性非常不利，需要让启动Elasticsearch时锁定内存
#
bootstrap.memory_lock: true
#
# Make sure that the heap size is set to about half the memory available
# on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this
# limit.
#
# Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
#
# ---------------------------------- Network    网络  -----------------------------------
#
# By default Elasticsearch is only accessible on localhost. Set a different
# address here to expose this node on the network:
#
network.host: 0.0.0.0
#
# By default Elasticsearch listens for HTTP traffic on the first free port it
# finds starting at 9200. Set a specific HTTP port here:
#
http.port: 9001
#集群通讯端口号
transport.port: 8001
#
# For more information, consult the network module documentation.
#
# --------------------------------- Discovery      发现   ----------------------------------
#
# Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when this node is started:
# The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
#
discovery.seed_hosts: ["192.168.0.130:8001","192.168.0.130:8002","192.168.0.130:8003","192.168.0.130:8004","192.168.0.130:8005","192.168.0.130:8006"]

#
# Bootstrap the cluster using an initial set of master-eligible nodes:
#
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["node9001","node9002","node9003"]
#
# For more information, consult the discovery and cluster formation module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Various      各色各样的   -----------------------------------
